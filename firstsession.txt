6/28/17 First session notes:

Computers:
HARDWARE (things you can see/touch, etc.)
- CPU: Central Processing Unit ("brain"). A computer can have many CPUs. 
- RAM: Random Access Memory ("scratch paper")
- Hard Disk ("notebook")
- USB: small version of a hard disk

SOFTWARE (things you can't see/touch, such as programs, etc.)
- Programs: examples-Word, Windows, etc.
- Given software does one thing, specific to that program
- Operating System: special kind of software, starts computer, interface between hardware/software and user. (Example: Windows 10)
- Program: series of actions/intructions/commands, sometimes with more data and sometimes without.

Number Systems:
BASE 10
- Our decimals, the system we usually use.

BINARY SYSTEM
- 1s and 0s

example: 
11011 (binary)
(1*2^4)+(1*2^3)+(0*2^2)+(1*2^1)+(1*2^0)= 16+8+0+2+1= 27 (base 10)

*11011 in binary and 27 in Base 10 are the same number expressed in different languages*

ASCII
- American Standard Code for Information Interchange --> system to make sure when an action is performed (pressing A for example), the same outcome occurs every time even when performed on different computers.
